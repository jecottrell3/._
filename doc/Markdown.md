## Escapes

No need to escape < or &, etc.  
\ is explicit escape.
May use things like \&copy; if desired: &copy;

Probably best to avoid contractions; confuses highlighter.  
Use **do not** or **don\&apos;t** instead of **don&apos;t**.

## paragraphs

Begin after a blank line and wrap.  
Explicit line breaks: end line with two spaces.  
Use `---` for horizontal rule. does not show up well.

---

## Text Attributes

Use `*italic*` and `**bold**` for *italic* and **bold**.  
Use `_italic_` and `__bold__` for _italic_ and __bold__.  
Use `~~strikethru~~` for ~~strikethru~~

## Code Blocks

Inline \`code block\`: `code block`

	paragraph code blocks are indented
	and not autowrapped
or
	This sentence has a
	```
	quoted
	code
	block
