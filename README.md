## Organization

Ahhhh, the Underhenge! -- The Eleventh Doctor

This is My Environment. All the Stuff I Care About. It's my dotfiles,
bin scripts, emacs customization, and things I have developed at
various places I've worked at. It also contains the Source of a few
programs.

The reason it's called ".\_" is to make it as invisible as possible. 

This space needs firther organization!
