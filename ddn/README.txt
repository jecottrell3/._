This directory contains several scripts I used at DDN.

Of note are h2d and h2n, which take a Hosts File and generate
DNS and DHCP files respectively. The scripts are Just Good Enough
To Be Useful; more work needs to be done. They are specific to DDN.

A demo version, useful for my Home Network, which uses the fake TLD
'homerj', can be run by typing ./H2N. It reads 'hosts' and writes 'homerj'
