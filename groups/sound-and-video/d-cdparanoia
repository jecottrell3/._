Description: Cdparanoia (Paranoia III) reads digital audio directly from a CD,
           : then writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or raw 16 bit
           : linear PCM format.  Cdparanoia doesn't contain any extra features
           : (like the ones included in the cdda2wav sampling utility).
           : Instead, cdparanoia's strength lies in its ability to handle a
           : variety of hardware, including inexpensive drives prone to
           : misalignment, frame jitter and loss of streaming during atomic
           : reads.  Cdparanoia is also good at reading and repairing data from
           : damaged CDs.
