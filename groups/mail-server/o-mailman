Description: Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much
           : like Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman
           : gives each mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe,
           : unsubscribe, etc. over the Web. Even the list manager can
           : administer his or her list entirely from the Web. Mailman also
           : integrates most things people want to do with mailing lists,
           : including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so on.
