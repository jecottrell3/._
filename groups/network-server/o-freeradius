Description: The FreeRADIUS Server Project is a high performance and highly
           : configurable GPL'd free RADIUS server. The server is similar in
           : some respects to Livingston's 2.0 server.  While FreeRADIUS started
           : as a variant of the Cistron RADIUS server, they don't share a lot
           : in common any more. It now has many more features than Cistron or
           : Livingston, and is much more configurable.
           : 
           : FreeRADIUS is an Internet authentication daemon, which implements
           : the RADIUS protocol, as defined in RFC 2865 (and others). It allows
           : Network Access Servers (NAS boxes) to perform authentication for
           : dial-up users. There are also RADIUS clients available for Web
           : servers, firewalls, Unix logins, and more.  Using RADIUS allows
           : authentication and authorization for a network to be centralized,
           : and minimizes the amount of re-configuration which has to be done
           : when adding or deleting new users.
