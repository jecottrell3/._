Description: Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
           : supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
           : caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
           : non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and
           : especially hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports
           : non-blocking DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed
           : requests.
           : 
           : Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
           : lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
           : (ftpget), and some management and client tools.
