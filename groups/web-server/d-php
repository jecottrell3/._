Description: PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
           : easy for developers to write dynamically generated webpages. PHP
           : also offers built-in database integration for several commercial
           : and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
           : database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
           : use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.
           : 
           : The php package contains the module which adds support for the PHP
           : language to Apache HTTP Server.
