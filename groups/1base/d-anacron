Summary    : A cron-like program that can run jobs lost during downtime.
License    : GPL
Description: Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.
           : It executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron,
           : it does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
           : therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
           : monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
           : don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
           : Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
           : intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
           : 
           : This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the
           : CentOS system. You should install this program if your system isn't
           : powered on 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of
           : other CentOS packages are executed each day.
