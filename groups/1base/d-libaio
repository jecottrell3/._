Summary    : Linux-native asynchronous I/O access library
License    : LGPL
Description: The Linux-native asynchronous I/O facility ("async I/O", or "aio")
           : has a richer API and capability set than the simple POSIX async I/O
           : facility. This library, libaio, provides the Linux-native API for
           : async I/O. The POSIX async I/O facility requires this library in
           : order to provide kernel-accelerated async I/O capabilities, as do
           : applications which require the Linux-native async I/O API.
