Description: mlocate is a locate/updatedb implementation.  It keeps a database
           : of all existing files and allows you to lookup files by name.
           : 
           : The 'm' stands for "merging": updatedb reuses the existing database
           : to avoid rereading most of the file system, which makes updatedb
           : faster and does not trash the system caches as much as traditional
           : locate implementations.
