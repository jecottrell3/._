Summary    : Programs for backing up and restoring ext2/ext3 filesystems

Description: The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines
           : files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up,
           : and copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or other storage
           : medium. The restore command performs the inverse function of dump;
           : it can restore a full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent
           : incremental backups can then be layered on top of the full backup.
           : Single files and directory subtrees may also be restored from full
           : or partial backups.
           : 
           : Install dump if you need a system for both backing up filesystems
           : and restoring filesystems after backups.
