Description: The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create,
           : manipulate, read, and write Zip archive files.
           : Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip
           : files. Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or
           : strings. Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced,
           : rearranged, and enumerated.  They can also be renamed or have their
           : dates, comments, or other attributes queried or modified.  Their
           : data can be compressed or uncompressed as needed.  Members can be
           : created from members in existing Zip files, or from existing
           : directories, files, or strings.
