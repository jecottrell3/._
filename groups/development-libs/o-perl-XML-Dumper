Summary    : Perl module for dumping Perl objects from/to XML
URL        : http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Dumper/
License    : GPL or Artistic
Description: XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to XML format. XML::Dumper can also
           : read XML data that was previously dumped by the module and convert
           : it back to Perl.  Perl objects are blessed back to their original
           : packaging; if the modules are installed on the system where the
           : perl objects are reconstituted from xml, they will behave as
           : expected. Intuitively, if the perl objects are converted and
           : reconstituted in the same environment, all should be well.
