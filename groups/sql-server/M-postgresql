Description: PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management
           : system (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including
           : transactions, subselects and user-defined types and functions). The
           : postgresql package includes the client programs and libraries that
           : you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQL
           : client programs are programs that directly manipulate the internal
           : structure of PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server. These
           : client programs can be located on the same machine with the
           : PostgreSQL server, or may be on a remote machine which accesses a
           : PostgreSQL server over a network connection. This package contains
           : the docs in HTML for the whole package, as well as command-line
           : utilities for managing PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server.
           : 
           : If you want to manipulate a PostgreSQL database on a remote
           : PostgreSQL server, you need this package. You also need to install
           : this package if you're installing the postgresql-server package.
