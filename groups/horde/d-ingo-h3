Description: Ingo, the "Email Filter Rules Manager", started as a frontend for
           : the Sieve filter language, and is now a generic and complete filter
           : rule frontend that currently is able to create Sieve, procmail, and
           : IMAP filter rules. The IMAP filter driver translates the filter
           : rules on demand to IMAP commands, executed via PHP's IMAP extension
           : and has replaced IMP's internal filtering code. It is now the
           : default filtering agent in IMP H3 (4.0).
