Summary    : imake source code configuration and build system

Description: Imake is a deprecated source code configuration and build system
           : which has traditionally been supplied by and used to build the X
           : Window System in X11R6 and previous releases.  As of the X Window
           : System X11R7 release, the X Window system has switched to using GNU
           : autotools as the primary build system, and the Imake system is now
           : deprecated, and should not be used by new software projects.
           : Software developers are encouraged to migrate software to the GNU
           : autotools system.
