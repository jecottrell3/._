Description: Splint is a tool for statically checking C programs for coding
           : errors and security vulnerabilities. With minimal effort, Splint
           : can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is invested
           : adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform even stronger
           : checks than can be done by any standard lint.
