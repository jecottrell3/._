Description: ElectricFence is a utility for C programming and
           : debugging. ElectricFence uses the virtual memory hardware of your

           : and/or to detect any accesses of memory released by
           : free(). ElectricFence will then stop the program on the first
           : instruction that caused a bounds violation and you can use your
           : favorite debugger to display the offending statement.
