Description: arts (analog real-time synthesizer) is the sound system of KDE 3.
           : 
           : The principle of arts is to create/process sound using small
           : modules which do certain tasks. These may be create a waveform
           : (oscillators), play samples, filter data, add signals, perform
           : effects like delay/flanger/chorus, or output the data to the
           : soundcard.
           : 
           : By connecting all those small modules together, you can perform
           : complex tasks like simulating a mixer, generating an instrument or
           : things like playing a wave file with some effects.
