Description: GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace
           : Ispell. It can either be used as a library or as an independent
           : spell checker. Its main feature is that it does a much better job
           : of coming up with possible suggestions than just about any other
           : spell checker out there for the English language, including Ispell
           : and Microsoft Word. It also has many other technical enhancements
           : over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries and
           : intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one
           : Aspell process is open at once.
