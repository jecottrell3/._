Summary    : A tool for creating scanners (text pattern recognizers).
URL        : http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/
License    : BSD
Description: The flex program generates scanners.  Scanners are programs which
           : can recognize lexical patterns in text.  Flex takes pairs of
           : regular expressions and C code as input and generates a C source
           : file as output.  The output file is compiled and linked with a
           : library to produce an executable.  The executable searches through
           : its input for occurrences of the regular expressions.  When a match
           : is found, it executes the corresponding C code.  Flex was designed
           : to work with both Yacc and Bison, and is used by many programs as
           : part of their build process.
           : 
           : You should install flex if you are going to use your system for
           : application development.
