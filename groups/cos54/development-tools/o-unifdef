Description: Unifdef is useful for removing ifdefed lines from a file while
           : otherwise leaving the file alone. Unifdef acts on #ifdef, #ifndef,
           : #else, and #endif lines, and it knows only enough about C and C++
           : to know when one of these is inactive because it is inside a
           : comment, or a single or double quote.
