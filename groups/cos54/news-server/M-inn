Summary    : The InterNetNews (INN) system, an Usenet news server.
License    : GPL
Description: INN (InterNetNews) is a complete system for serving Usenet news
           : and/or private newsfeeds.  INN includes innd, an NNTP (NetNews
           : Transport Protocol) server, and nnrpd, a newsreader that is spawned
           : for each client.  Both innd and nnrpd vary slightly from the NNTP
           : protocol, but not in ways that are easily noticed.
           : 
           : Install the inn package if you need a complete system for serving
           : and reading Usenet news.  You may also need to install inn-devel,
           : if you are going to use a separate program which interfaces to INN,
           : like newsgate or tin.
