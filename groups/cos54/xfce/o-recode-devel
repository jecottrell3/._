Description: The `recode' library converts files between character sets and
           : usages. The library recognises or produces nearly 150 different
           : character sets and is able to transliterate files between almost
           : any pair. When exact transliteration are not possible, it may get
           : rid of the offending characters or fall back on approximations.
           : Most RFC 1345 character sets are supported.
