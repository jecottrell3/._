Description: This module provides a way to process XML documents. It is build on
           : top of XML::Parser.  XML::Twig offers a tree interface to the
           : document, while allowing you to output the parts of it that have
           : been completely processed.  It allows minimal resource (CPU and
           : memory) usage by building the tree only for the parts of the
           : documents that need actual processing, through the use of the
           : twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots options.
