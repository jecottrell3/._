Description: Bison is a general purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
           : description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C program to
           : parse that grammar. Bison can be used to develop a wide range of
           : language parsers, from ones used in simple desk calculators to
           : complex programming languages. Bison is upwardly compatible with
           : Yacc, so any correctly written Yacc grammar should work with Bison
           : without any changes. If you know Yacc, you shouldn't have any
           : trouble using Bison. You do need to be very proficient in C
           : programming to be able to use Bison. Bison is only needed on
           : systems that are used for development.
           : 
           : If your system will be used for C development, you should install
           : Bison.
