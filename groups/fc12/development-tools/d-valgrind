Description: Valgrind is a tool to help you find memory-management problems in
           : your programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision,
           : all reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
           : malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can
           : detect a lot of problems that are otherwise very hard to
           : find/diagnose.
