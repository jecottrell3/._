Summary    : A C programming language indexing and/or cross-reference tool.
URL        : http://ctags.sourceforge.net/
License    : GPL
Description: Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of C language objects found
           : in C source and header files.  The index makes it easy for text
           : editors or other utilities to locate the indexed items.  Ctags can
           : also generate a cross reference file which lists information about
           : the various objects found in a set of C language files in human
           : readable form.  Exuberant Ctags improves on ctags because it can
           : find all types of C language tags, including macro definitions,
           : enumerated values (values inside enum{...}), function and method
           : definitions, enum/struct/union tags, external function prototypes,
           : typedef names and variable declarations.  Exuberant Ctags is far
           : less likely to be fooled by code containing #if preprocessor
           : conditional constructs than ctags.  Exuberant ctags supports output
           : of Emacs style TAGS files and can be used to print out a list of
           : selected objects found in source files.
