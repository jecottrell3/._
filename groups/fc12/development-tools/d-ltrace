License    : GPL
Description: Ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until
           : the command exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace
           : intercepts and records both the dynamic library calls called by the
           : executed process and the signals received by the executed process.
           : Ltrace can also intercept and print system calls executed by the
           : process.
           : 
           : You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking
           : the execution of processes.
