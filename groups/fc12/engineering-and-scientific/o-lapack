Description: LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a standard library for numerical
           : linear algebra. LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of
           : simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear
           : systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
           : problems. Associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD,
           : Schur, and generalized Schur) and related computations (i.e.,
           : reordering of Schur factorizations and estimating condition
           : numbers) are also included. LAPACK can handle dense and banded
           : matrices, but not general sparse matrices. Similar functionality is
           : provided for real and complex matrices in both single and double
           : precision. LAPACK is coded in Fortran77 and built with gcc.
