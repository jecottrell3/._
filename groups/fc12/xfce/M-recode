Description: The `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.
           : It recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets
           : and is able to transliterate files between almost any pair. When
           : exact transliteration are not possible, it may get rid of the
           : offending characters or fall back on approximations.  Most RFC 1345
           : character sets are supported.
