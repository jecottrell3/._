Description: mcs is a library and set of userland tools which abstract the
           : storage of configuration settings away from userland applications.
           : 
           : It is hoped that by using mcs, that the applications which use it
           : will generally have a more congruent feeling in regards to
           : settings.
           : 
           : There have been other projects like this before (such as GConf),
           : but unlike those projects, mcs strictly handles abstraction. It
           : does not impose any specific data storage requirement, nor is it
           : tied to any desktop environment or software suite.
           : 
           : This package contains the files necessary for writing programs that
           : use mcs.
