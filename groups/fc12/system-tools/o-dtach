Description: 
           : dtach is a program that emulates the detach feature of screen, with
           : less overhead.  It is designed to be transparent and un-intrusive;
           : it avoids interpreting the input and output between attached
           : terminals and the program under its control. Consequently, it works
           : best with full-screen applications such as emacs.
