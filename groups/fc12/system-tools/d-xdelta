Description: Xdelta (X for XCF: the eXperimental Computing Facility at Berkeley)
           : is a binary delta generator (like a diff program for binaries) and
           : an RCS version control replacement library. The Xdelta library
           : performs its work independently of the actual format used to encode
           : the file and is intended to be used by various higher-level
           : programs such as XCF's Project Revision Control System (PRCS).
           : PRCS is a front end for a version control toolset.  Xdelta uses a
           : binary file delta algorithm to replace the standard diff program
           : used by RCS.
