License    : GPL
Description: RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol which
           : allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own IP
           : addresses from the RARP server.  Some machines (e.g. SPARC boxes)
           : use this protocol instead of e.g. DHCP to query their IP addresses
           : during network bootup. Linux kernels up to 2.2 used to provide a
           : kernel daemon for this service, but since 2.3 kernels it is served
           : by this userland daemon.
           : 
           : You should install rarpd if you want to set up a RARP server on
           : your network.
