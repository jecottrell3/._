Summary    : A server process which provides boot information to diskless
           : clients.
License    : BSD
Description: The bootparamd process provides bootparamd, a server process which
           : provides the information needed by diskless clients in order for
           : them to successfully boot.  Bootparamd looks first in
           : /etc/bootparams for an entry for that particular client; if a local
           : bootparams file doesn't exist, it looks at the appropriate Network
           : Information Service (NIS) map.  Some network boot loaders (notably
           : Sun's) rely on special boot server code on the server, in addition
           : to the RARP and TFTP servers. This bootparamd server process is
           : compatible with SunOS bootparam clients and servers which need that
           : boot server code.
           : 
           : You should install bootparamd if you need to provide boot
           : information to diskless clients on your network.
