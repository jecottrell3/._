Summary    : The TeX text formatting system.

Description: TeTeX is an implementation of TeX for Linux or UNIX systems. TeX
           : takes a text file and a set of formatting commands as input and
           : creates a typesetter-independent .dvi (DeVice Independent) file as
           : output. Usually, TeX is used in conjunction with a higher level
           : formatting package like LaTeX or PlainTeX, since TeX by itself is
           : not very user-friendly. The output format needn't to be DVI, but
           : also PDF, when using pdflatex or similar tools.
           : 
           : Install tetex if you want to use the TeX text formatting system.
           : Consider to install tetex-latex (a higher level formatting package
           : which provides an easier-to-use interface for TeX). Unless you are
           : an expert at using TeX, you should also install the tetex-doc
           : package, which includes the documentation for TeX.
