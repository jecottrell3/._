Summary    : Creates an initial ramdisk image for preloading modules.
License    : GPL
Description: Mkinitrd creates filesystem images for use as initial ramdisk
           : (initrd) images.  These ramdisk images are often used to preload
           : the block device modules (SCSI or RAID) needed to access the root
           : filesystem.
           : 
           : In other words, generic kernels can be built without drivers for
           : any SCSI adapters which load the SCSI driver as a module.  Since
           : the kernel needs to read those modules, but in this case it isn't
           : able to address the SCSI adapter, an initial ramdisk is used.  The
           : initial ramdisk is loaded by the operating system loader (normally
           : LILO) and is available to the kernel as soon as the ramdisk is
           : loaded.  The ramdisk image loads the proper SCSI adapter and allows
           : the kernel to mount the root filesystem.  The mkinitrd program
           : creates such a ramdisk using information found in the
           : /etc/modules.conf file.
