Summary    : A GNU archiving program.
URL        : http://www.gnu.org/software/cpio/
License    : GPL
Description: GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.
           : Archives are files which contain a collection of other files plus
           : information about them, such as their file name, owner, timestamps,
           : and access permissions.  The archive can be another file on the
           : disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.  GNU cpio supports the following
           : archive formats:  binary, old ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary,
           : HPUX old ASCII, old tar and POSIX.1 tar.  By default, cpio creates
           : binary format archives, so that they are compatible with older cpio
           : programs.  When it is extracting files from archives, cpio
           : automatically recognizes which kind of archive it is reading and
           : can read archives created on machines with a different byte-order.
           : 
           : Install cpio if you need a program to manage file archives.
