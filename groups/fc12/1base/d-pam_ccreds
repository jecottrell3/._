Summary    : Pam module to cache login credentials
License    : GPL
Description: The pam_ccreds module provides a mechanism for caching
           : credentials when authenticating against a network
           : authentication service, so that authentication can still
           : proceed when the service is down. Note at present no
           : mechanism is provided for caching _authorization_
           : information, i.e. whether you are allowed to login once
           : authenticated.
