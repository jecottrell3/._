Description: Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
           : users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all)
           : commands as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo
           : operates on a per-command basis.  It is not a replacement for the
           : shell.  Features include: the ability to restrict what commands a
           : user may run on a per-host basis, copious logging of each command
           : (providing a clear audit trail of who did what), a configurable
           : timeout of the sudo command, and the ability to use the same
           : configuration file (sudoers) on many different machines.
