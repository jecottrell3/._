Description: IrDA(TM) (Infrared Data Association) is an industry standard for
           : wireless, infrared communication between devices. IrDA speeds range
           : from 9600 bps to 4 Mbps, and IrDA can be used by many modern
           : devices including laptops, LAN adapters, PDAs, printers, and mobile
           : phones.
           : 
           : The Linux-IrDA project is a GPL'd implementation, written from
           : scratch, of the IrDA protocols. Supported IrDA protocols include
           : IrLAP, IrLMP, IrIAP, IrTTP, IrLPT, IrLAN, IrCOMM and IrOBEX.
           : 
           : The irda-utils package contains a collection of programs that
           : enable the use of IrDA protocols. Most IrDA features are
           : implemented in the kernel, so IrDA support must be enabled in the
           : kernel before any IrDA tools or programs can be used. Some
           : configuration outside the kernel is required, however, and some
           : IrDA features, like IrOBEX, are actually implemented outside the
           : kernel.
