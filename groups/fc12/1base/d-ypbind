           : group information) to all of the machines on a network. NIS can
           : allow users to log in on any machine on the network, as long as the
           : machine has the NIS client programs running and the user's password
           : is recorded in the NIS passwd database. NIS was formerly known as
           : Sun Yellow Pages (YP).
