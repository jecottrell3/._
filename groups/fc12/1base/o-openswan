Summary    : Openswan IPSEC implementation
URL        : http://www.openswan.org/
License    : GPLv2+
Description: Openswan is a free implementation of IPsec & IKE for Linux.  IPsec
           : is the Internet Protocol Security and uses strong cryptography to
           : provide both authentication and encryption services.  These
           : services allow you to build secure tunnels through untrusted
           : networks.  Everything passing through the untrusted net is
           : encrypted by the ipsec gateway machine and decrypted by the gateway
           : at the other end of the tunnel.  The resulting tunnel is a virtual
           : private network or VPN.
           : 
           : This package contains the daemons and userland tools for setting up
           : Openswan. It optionally also builds the Openswan KLIPS IPsec stack
           : that is an alternative for the NETKEY/XFRM IPsec stack that exists
           : in the default Linux kernel.
           : 
           : Openswan 2.6.x also supports IKEv2 (RFC4309)
