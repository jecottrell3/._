Summary    : Lightweight Scripting for Java

Description: BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter
           : with object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell
           : executes standard Java statements and expressions, in addition to
           : obvious scripting commands and syntax. BeanShell supports scripted
           : objects as simple method closures like those in Perl and
           : JavaScript(tm). You can use BeanShell interactively for Java
           : experimentation and debugging or as a simple scripting engine for
           : your applications. In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted
           : Java, plus some useful stuff. Another way to describe it is to say
           : that in many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell
           : is embeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications
           : to execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide
           : scripting extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you
           : can call your Java applications and objects from BeanShell; working
           : with Java objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written
           : in Java and runs in the same space as your application, you can
           : freely pass references to "real live" objects into scripts and
           : return them as results.
