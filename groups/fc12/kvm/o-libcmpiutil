Description: Libcmpiutil is a library of utility functions for CMPI providers.
           : The goal is to reduce the amount of repetitive work done in
           : most CMPI providers by encapsulating common procedures with more
           : "normal" APIs.  This extends from operations like getting typed
           : instance properties to standardizing method dispatch and argument
           : checking.
